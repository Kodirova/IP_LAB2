                Levi is the son of Kuchel Ackerman, a prostitute who worked in the Underground and was made pregnant by one of her clients. One day, Kenny Ackerman, Kuchel's older brother, came to the city to see her only to find that she was dead.[25] There, he found a young and squalid Levi sitting in front of his mother's bed.

                In a rare showing of compassion, Kenny decided to take care of him. He raised Levi as well as he could: teaching him knife skills, how to get along with people, and violent behavior. Levi also learned to use his own inner power that he possessed as a member of the Ackerman clan.[26]
                
                Time passed and eventually, Kenny taught Levi everything he knew. However, he did not consider himself as a good father figure.[27][28] One day, in the subterranean city, Levi started a fight which he won easily. At that moment, Kenny decided to leave him behind, satisfied that he had taught Levi the skills he needed to survive.[29]
                
                Later, he became a notorious thug in the underground but eventually left the place to join the Survey Corps.[3] Although he was at odds with Erwin,[30] he ended up becoming one of his most trusted men.
